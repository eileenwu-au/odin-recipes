			<p>Who doesn't love a good baked potato? There's just something about the crispy skin and fluffy, pillowy interior that I can't get enough of—it's one of my favorite ways to prepare the spud. When I'm in the mood to amp things up, I love to load up my baked potatoes with cheese, sour cream, bacon, and more and then give them a brief second turn in the oven, to get all creamy and melty. Whether you're looking for a hearty side to a weeknight dinner, an impressive accompaniment to a holiday meal, or simply an easy meal all on its own, these cheesy loaded baked potatoes are sure to please.</p>
			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>4 large russet potatoes</li>
				<li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
				<li>2 scallions, thinly sliced, white and green parts separated</li>
				<li>4 Tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
				<li>1/4 cup sliced chives</li>
				<li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
				<li>3/4 cup shredded cheddar, divided</li>
				<li>6 slices cooked crispy bacon, crumbled, divided</li>
				<li>Kosher salt</li>
				<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Arrange a rack in center of oven; preheat to 400°. Prick potatoes all over with a fork or sharp knife. Drizzle with oil, then tightly wrap in foil.</li>
				<li>Bake potatoes until a knife can be easily inserted into center, about 1 hour.</li>
				<li>Unwrap potatoes and cut lengthwise slits in the top of each. Carefully scoop out flesh from center of each potato into a medium bowl. Add white scallion parts, butter, chives, sour cream, half of cheddar, and half of bacon; season with salt and pepper.</li>
				<li>Spoon filling back into each potato, mounding on top. Sprinkle with remaining cheese.</li>
				<li>Continue to bake potatoes until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Top with green scallion parts and remaining bacon.</li>
