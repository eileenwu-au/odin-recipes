			<p>Though you can find gyoza in many eating places in Japan, the most traditional place they are found is in ramen joints. The main thing you will find, especially outside of Japan, is that there is more cabbage used so the filling is less “meaty”, and there is very little garlic flavour. Don’t skimp on the meat!!! And definitely don’t skimp on the garlic flavour!!!</p>
			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<h3>Filling</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>1 1/2 cups green cabbage, very finely chopped</li>
				<li>1 tsp salt, separated</li>
				<li>1 lb / 500g ground pork (mince) (fattier the better)</li>
				<li>1 cup garlic chives, finely chopped</li>
				<li>1 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
				<li>1 tsp ginger, grated</li>
				<li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
				<li>1 tbsp cornstarch / corn flour</li>
				<li>2 tsp soy sauce</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Gyoza</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>1 tsp cornflour (cornstarch) – for tray</li>
				<li>40 – 45 round wonton (gyoza) wrappers (Gow Gee wrappers) – 1 1/2 packets</li>
				<li>3 tbsp vegetable oil (or other cooking oil)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Dipping sauce</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Soy sauce</li>
				<li>Rice wine vinegar</li>
				<li>Chilli oil (Rayu is Japanese chilli oil)</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Combine cabbage and 1/2 tsp salt in a small bowl, then set aside for 20 minutes to allow the cabbage to wilt slightly.</li>
				<li>Place remaining Filling ingredients (including remaining 1/2 tsp salt) in a large bowl. Squeeze out any excess water from the cabbage and add to the bowl.</li>
				<li>Use your hands to mix the Filling.</li>
				<li>Sprinkle a baking tray with 1 tsp of cornstarch / cornflour.</li>
				<li>Place 1 gyoza wrapper on your palm (left hand for right-handed people). Dip your finger in water and run it around the edge of half the gyoza wrapper (to seal).</li>
				<li>Place 1 slightly heaped tbsp of Filling on the wrapper. Fold wrapper over and use your right hand assisted by your left hand thumb to create 4 pleats. Press to seal and place on the tray. Repeat with remaining wrappers.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>To cook</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large skillet (that has a lid) over medium high heat.</li>
					<li>Place about 12 gyoza in rows, slightly overlapping each other. Cook until the underside is light golden, then pour 1/3 cup of water around the gyoza and place the lid on.</li>
					<li>Cook until the water has completely evaporated (so the golden underside is not wet and soggy) and the wrapper is slightly translucent on top – about 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
					<li>Use an egg flip to transfer onto a plate upside down i.e. golden side up.</li>
					<li>Serve with Dipping Sauce.</li>
				</ol>
			<h3>Dipping sauce</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Serve each ingredient separately so people can mix according to their taste. I use about equal portions of soy sauce and vinegar with a generous splash of chili oil.</li>
			</ol>
