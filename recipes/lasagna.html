			<p>What makes this classic lasagna recipe so spectacular? Homemade meat sauce and plenty of cheese. Best of all, it's easy to make lasagna ahead of time so dinner can be ready in a flash. See below for the list of ingredients and just follow the simple steps to create your own lasagna.</p>
			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
				<li>1-1/4 pounds bulk Italian sausage</li>
				<li>3/4 pound ground beef</li>
				<li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
        		<li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        		<li>2 cans (one 28 ounces, one 15 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
        		<li>2 cans (6 ounces each) tomato paste</li>
        		<li>2/3 cup water</li>
        		<li>2 to 3 tablespoons sugar</li>
        		<li>3 tablespoons plus 1/4 cup minced fresh parsley, divided</li>
        		<li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        		<li>3/4 teaspoon fennel seed</li>
        		<li>3/4 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
        		<li>1/4 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper</li>
        		<li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        		<li>1 carton (15 ounces) ricotta cheese</li>
        		<li>4 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
        		<li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the noodles according to the package directions. When complete, drain the noodles, and set aside. Meanwhile, heat a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the bulk Italian sausage, ground beef and diced onion. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until the meat is no longer pink, breaking up the meat with a large spoon as it cooks to create gorgeous crumbles. Add the garlic, and cook for one minute, until the mixture is fragrant. Editor's Tip: To ensure the noodles will not stick to each other, stir the water like a whirlpool when you add the pasta sheets.</li>
				<li>Drain the mixture in the Dutch oven. Then, add the remaining sauce ingredients: crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, water, sugar, 3 tablespoons parsley, basil, fennel, 1\/2 teaspoon salt and coarsely ground pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
				<li>In a small bowl, whisk together the egg, ricotta cheese, and remaining 1\/4 cup parsley and 1\/4 teaspoon salt. If you haven\u2019t already, grate the mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Editor\u2019s Tip: For the freshest, creamiest taste, grate your own cheese at home.</li>
				<li>Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0. Spoon 2 cups meat sauce into an ungreased 13x9-inch baking dish, spreading it out to cover the entire dish. Layer three noodles onto the sauce. Add one-third of the ricotta mixture, spreading it over the noodles with a rubber spatula or an icing spatula. Sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella cheese and 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers twice, finishing with remaining meat sauce and cheeses. The dish will be very full by the time you get to the top!</li>
				<li>Cover the baking dish, and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the cover, and cook for an additional 25 minutes, until the sauce is bubbling around the edges and the cheese is fully melted. Let the lasagna stand for 15 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
